# PathfinderProgram
My home-brew program for a Pathfinder character sheet, as requested.

So far I'm just working on the character sheet aspect of it, but I've also heard some interest in NPC generation or 
things like encounter generators.


####Currently Working On: Organizing the classes.
They definitely need some work before they're clear and concise.

#####Next Issues: Setting up the actual character creation process.
Simple stuff - choosing your race, name, and ability score modifiers. I'd like to make a non-guided and a guided version.
The guided would have stuff like info on the races, and some various ways to determine your ability scores.
The hardest part of this will just be figuring out how to make it look pretty.



#####GUI Thoughts:
Will need some extra tabs made up for classes with things like ki, and alchemists with their discoveries.
Find some free images to use here and there - to spruce things up. Alternatively, ask someone to draw some up?
