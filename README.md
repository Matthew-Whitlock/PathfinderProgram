# PathfinderProgram
My home-brew program for a Pathfinder character sheet, as requested.

So far I'm just working on the character sheet aspect of it, but I've also heard some interest in NPC generation or 
things like encounter generators.


####Current issue: Create an enum/TSV system for races.

#####Next Issues: 
Creating an Enum system for races/classes - Could also do a TSV system for this, for more configuration power, and ability to add new races/classes. More complex, though
Fixing the web browser system for details on DC checks etc. for Skill's 


#####GUI Thoughts:  
Finish up the basic layout currently made.  
Feat choosing should pull up the same system for details as Spell choosing.  
Look at doing a tabbed system for the inventory/feats&abilities/spells/basic info  - In progress.
