# PathfinderProgram
My home-brew program for a Pathfinder character sheet, as requested.

So far I'm just working on the character sheet aspect of it, but I've also heard some interest in NPC generation or 
things like encounter generators.

Also, this is soooo far from java coding standards. Yes, everything is public. Yes, there's barely any encapsulation. Yes, it's out of 
the proper com.github.etc.etc.etc format. But I'm super lazy, and it's much more of a personal project than aimed at distribution. So,
if you feel like cleaning it up feel free to submit a pull request, but I'm not likely at all to do it.
