# PathfinderProgram
My home-brew program for a Pathfinder character sheet, as requested.

So far I'm just working on the character sheet aspect of it, but I've also heard some interest in NPC generation or 
things like encounter generators.


####Currently Working On: Sprucing up the UI.  
I want it looking decent and workable, rather than programmatically concise, for now. I'd like some feedback on if it actually follows game mechanics well.

#####Next Issues: Setting up the "Settings" tab  
It should mostly contain things like resetting things to default. E.G. if you set an image that the program can't find, there's nothing for you to double click on currently to fix the issue. Resetting customizations to items, resetting stat customizations, etc. Basically just a settings tab for setting all of the "player modifications" fields to empty.

Item Modifications  
A system for modifying the details of items. It can be pretty simple for now, since most item details don't actually have impact on the program, so it can be just modifying a big chunk of text, with a couple things separate like AC Penalty etc.


#####GUI Thoughts:
Will need some extra tabs made up for classes with things like ki, and alchemists with their discoveries.
