# PathfinderProgram
My home-brew program for a Pathfinder character sheet, as requested.

So far I'm just working on the character sheet aspect of it, but I've also heard some interest in NPC generation or 
things like encounter generators.


####Currently Working On: Setting up proper searching for items.

#####Next Issues: 
Creating an Enum system for races/classes - Could also do a TSV system for this, for more configuration power, and ability to add new races/classes. More complex, though  


#####GUI Thoughts:  
Find some free images to use here and there - to spruce things up. Alternatively, ask someone to draw some up?
